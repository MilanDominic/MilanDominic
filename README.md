- 👋 Hi, I’m @MilanDominic
- 👀 I’m interested in Music Production, 3D Modeling, Game Dev, Web Dev and talking about all sorts of creative endeavors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the above, some coding languages and what ever else crosses my path.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything creative.
- 📫 How to reach me on socials? That might be a bit tricky, as for now I'm trying to stay away from it so I can use my time more wisely.
You could reach me on socials but it might take some time before I respond. Once in conversation I will be more eager to set up better conditions for this.
